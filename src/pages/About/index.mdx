<p>
  The Technical Fellowship is a self-governing body of experts and developers of
  Polkadot and Kusama networks protocols. It operates on-chain through the
  Polkadot
  [Collectives](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot-collectives-rpc.polkadot.io#/fellowship/referenda)
  system chain and off-chain through the [Polkadot
  Fellows](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows) repository.
</p>

The Polkadot Fellowship was established in 2022 and plays an important role
in the Polkadot OpenGov. This fellowship replaced the [Technical
Committee](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee)
from Polkadot's first iteration of governance and will serve both the
Polkadot and Kusama networks.

Designed to accommodate a broad membership base, the Fellowship aims to work
effectively with even tens of thousands of members. It features low barriers
to entry regarding administrative processes and levels of expertise. For
more information, read through the [Fellowship
Manifesto](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/manifesto/blob/0c3df46d76625980b8b48742cb86f4d8fa6dda8d/manifesto.pdf).

Apart from the collectives system chain and the GitHub repository, the Polkadot Fellowship
also uses multiple public avenues to discuss updates related to the Polkadot protocol See Element sidebar links and [Monthly calls](https://polkadot-fellows.github.io/dashboard/#/opendev) page.

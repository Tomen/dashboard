  The Polkadot Technical Fellowship is a self-governing body of experts and
  developers of Polkadot and Kusama networks. It operates on-chain through the
  Polkadot
  [Collectives](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot-collectives-rpc.polkadot.io#/fellowship/referenda)
  system chain and off-chain through the [Polkadot
  Fellows](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows) repository.
</p>

## Background

<p>
  The Polkadot Technical Fellowship was established in 2022 and plays an
  important role in the Polkadot OpenGov. This fellowship replaced the
  [Technical
  Committee](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee)
  from Polkadot's first iteration of governance and serves both the Polkadot and
  Kusama networks.
</p>
<p>
  Designed to accommodate a broad membership base, the Fellowship features low
  barriers for administrative processes and assigns different levels of
  expertise to its members.

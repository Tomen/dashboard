## Technical Fellowship Referenda

The fellowship's governance model has multiple tracks with their own approval and support
parameters, where the votes are weighted by the rank of the member. Members of the Fellowship can
vote on any given Fellowship proposal and the aggregated opinion of the members (weighted by their
rank) constitutes the Fellowship's collective opinion. The list of current and historic fellowship
referenda can be viewed on [Polkassembly](https://collectives.polkassembly.io/) or
[Subsquare.](https://collectives.subsquare.io/) The fellowship governance is primarily used for its
membership management, [approving RFCs](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs) and whitelisting
Polkadot OpenGov proposals created on the whitelist track.

### Whitelisting

Polkadot OpenGov allows the Technical Fellowship to authorize an origin known as
"Whitelisted-Caller" to execute with Root-level privileges for calls approved by the Fellowship
(currently only rank 3 members and above can vote for whitelist calls). Note that the
fellowship cannot unanimously change the network parameters, conduct rescues or move assets. The
whitelisted proposals still have to go through the whole life cycle of an OpenGov referendum and can
only be enacted when the referendum passes successfully.

The whitelisting process starts as a fellowship referenda with embedded XCM call from the
collectives system chain to the Polkadot relay chain. For instance,
[the Polkadot Fellowship referenda 68](https://collectives.polkassembly.io/referenda/68) was used to
**whitelist** [the Polkadot OpenGov referenda 440](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/440).

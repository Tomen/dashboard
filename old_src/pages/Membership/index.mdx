## Management

The Polkadot technical Fellowship was initally [seeded](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/seeding)
with its members and their corresponding ranks, and got
[added on to Polkadot's Collectives](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/403) system chain. All
new membership requests will go through the fellowship governance and the procedure is outlined in
the section below.

### Becoming a Member

As a member of the Polkadot Fellowship, you are expected to faithfully uphold the below
tenets:

- Sincerely uphold the interests of Polkadot and avoid actions which clearly work against it.
- Respect the philosophy and principles of Polkadot.
- Respect the operational procedures, norms and voting conventions of the Fellowship.
- Respect fellow Members and the wider community.

  <p>

    For new fellowship inductions, Polkassembly has created an interface (still in beta) to
    [apply for the Polkadot Fellowship.](https://collectives.polkassembly.io/join-fellowship?network=collectives)
    This initiative is funded by Polkadot treasury through
    [OpenGov referendum 373](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/574)

  </p>

The fellowship manifesto states that any account may register to become a candidate for a basic
deposit, but that feature has not been added to the collectives runtime yet. To be added as a
candidate of the Polkadot Fellowship, a pre-existing member with rank greater than or
equal to 1 can initiate the process. The fellowship membership management is administered through
the
[core fellowship](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/substrate/frame/core-fellowship/src/lib.rs)
pallet.

An existing Technical Fellowship member with rank greater than or equal to 1 can submit the signed
`induct` call, as shown below. It is recommended that the candidate account has a verified identity.
Upon successfuly execution of the extrinsic, the candidate's account will be displayed on the
[Fellowship Overview](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot-collectives-rpc.polkadot.io#/fellowship)
tab on Polkadot-JS UI.

### Rank Updates

The Polkadot Fellowship members are expected to provide a periodic evidence to request for
retaining their rank or to get promoted to a higher rank.

Read more in the [**Evidences repo**](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/Evidences).

#### Promotion

Any fellowship member upto rank 4 can be
promoted to the next rank through a fellowship referenda that can be voted by the members who are 2
ranks higher. For instance, the fellowship
[referenda 64](https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/referenda/64) which promotes a member
from rank 1 to rank 2 can only be voted by members whose ranks are greater than or equal to 3.
Promotion of the Polkadot Fellowship members from rank 5 needs to be done through an OpenGov
referendum.

This preimage example should include the call to `promote` an account to a specific rank, as shown
below. This preimage can be added by any account on the collectives system chain.

<img className={"adj-img"} src={preimagepromote} alt="preimage" />

In the snapshot below, the submission track is chosen as `21/Promote to I Dan`, origin as
`FellowshipOrigins` and fellowship origins as `PromoteTo1Dan`. This selection should work for
promoting a candidate with rank 0 to a member with rank 1.

<img className={"adj-img"} src={proposalpromote} alt="proposal" />

For promoting a member from Rank 1 to Rank 2, the submission track can be chosen as `22/Promote to  II Dan`, origin as
`FellowshipOrigins` and fellowship origins as `PromoteTo2Dan`. Only the members with Rank >= 3 can
vote on this proposal.

#### Retain Rank

To retain a rank, the Polkadot Fellowship members are expected to submit evidence of work in an
on-going basis.

#### Demotion and Suspension

**Demotion** occurs automatically after a given period has elapsed, and the member is unable to
defend their position to their peers.

**Suspension** can happen only through a Polkadot OpenGov referendum, which ensures that the
Fellowship's bias alone does not necessarily result in expulsion.
